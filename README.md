# IO.Insure Project Manager

  The project manager is a web-app created with **Vuetify**, **VueX** and **Vue Router** and designed to help its users to create projects and assign members to compose and manage that project in a easy, fast and interactive way.
  
  ### How does it works?

  After running the web-app, the user can describe their project name, description (optional), inform start and ending dates (optional) and in the end, assign members to that project by searching for their name or their username in the search users bar.
  
  Once the form is submitted, the projects and the team members will show in a list.
